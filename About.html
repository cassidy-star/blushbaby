	<p id="p4"> We are two in super intrgued fashion women. From a very young age, we knew that fashion was something we going to do. In seventh grade we already  each had our design books and were working on a collab. We were more than just fascinated but the idea of becoming fashion designers. We knew in our hearts of hearts that its going to happen. We were kinda shooting but not aiming just yet . There were times when people would ask us about out game plan, to be honest we ourselves hardly knew what it was . However what we did know was that we going to be designers.<br/><br/>
	The difference that we bringing is to show and proof to all; that naturally you'll have that affection about what it is you love to doing.That thing you just simply cant stop thinking about . It even keeps you up planning ways to make it a reality. We here to tell you to do it ! Its your calling .
	We come from a town were dreams arent really highlighted or encouraged, but a 9 to 5 is .We eventually had to surpass that way of thinking and chase our dreams <br/><br/>
	 Thus we encourage you to do the same and hope that our little messge will inspire you to do the  same and chase your dreams !</p><br/>
