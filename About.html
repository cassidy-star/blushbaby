	<p id="p4"> We are two in super intrigued fashion women. From a very young age, we knew that fashion was something we were going to do. In seventh grade we already  each had our design books and were working on a collab. We were more than just fascinated by the idea of becoming fashion designers. We knew in our hearts of hearts that it's going to happen. We were kinda shooting but not aiming just yet. There were times when people would ask us about our game plan, to be honest, we ourselves hardly knew what it was. However, what we did know was that were going to be designers.<br/><br/>
	The difference that we bringing is to show and prove to all; that naturally, you'll have that idea about what it is you love to doing. That thing you just simply can't stop thinking about. It even keeps you up planning ways to make it a reality. We here to tell you to do it ! Its your calling.
	We come from a town where dreams aren't really highlighted or encouraged, but a 9 to 5 is. We eventually had to surpass that way of thinking and chase our dreams <br/><br/>
	 Thus we encourage you to do the same and hope that our little message will inspire you to do the  same and chase your dreams !</p><br/>
